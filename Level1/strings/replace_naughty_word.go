We all know that uvavu is the more unbearable insult in Klingon.
Below you'll find a message intercepted by our nicebot on alt.mars101.
Write code that will replace uvavu by something more appropriate like fruitcake.
And also remove the n so that it reads properly : such a fruitcake.

Get going, your time to code now ! :)`
